A little puzzle that I couldn't solve. Would love to get some help because it is driving me crazy haha. Please tell me (on Reddit for instance, or by email) if you found a solution. Thank you very much :)

Rules:
1-The spaceship must visit all squares
2-spaceship can't get outside of the colored squares
3-use the f1 function to create 6 or less actions to perform, not more.
4-you can include a specific color rule for each action (for instance turn left IF suqare is green, go forward IF square is yellow...). Or just an action without any requirements (go forward).
5-you can of course call the f1 function again inside the function.

Tell me if not working properly.
